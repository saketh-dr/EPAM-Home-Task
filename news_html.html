          <div class="content">
            Union Commerce, Industry and Textiles Minister Piyush Goyal 
            on Friday unveiled a new Foreign Trade Policy that moves away 
            from providing incentives to exporters, but lowers a few costs 
            for smaller firms and promises swifter clearances, along with a 
            one-time amnesty scheme for export obligation defaults. Replacing 
            the extant policy that had been in place since 2015, the new policy 
            kicks in from 2023-24 and aims to almost triple India’s goods and 
            services exports to $2 trillion by 2030, from an estimated $760 billion in 2022-23.

            first humans on the Moon. It is also tasked with helping the agency 
            set up a long-term presence on the Moon.

          <div class="time">March 30, 2023 14:00 IST</div>
          <div class="content">
            Indonesian players and fans were left dismayed on Thursday after the 
            country was dropped as host of the under-20 soccer World Cup following 
            outrage among politicians in the predominantly Muslim country about 
            Israel’s participation. International soccer’s governing body FIFA 
            stripped Indonesia of hosting rights on Wednesday over what an Indonesian 
            official said was a failure to honour its commitments to the tournament.
